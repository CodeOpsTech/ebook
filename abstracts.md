*Session: Devops in a Serverless World*

Devops is about creating a cultures of high performance organizations. The principles are universal regardless of infrastructure choices. In this presentation we will look at the Devops best practices and how they manifest in a serverless environment.

*Session: Building AI-powered Serverless Applications on AWS*

In this talk, I will show the audience how to build and deploy serverless AI-powered applications on AWS. In particular, two demos will be analysed in depths. The first demo is a mobile web app that allows a user to upload or take a picture with their mobile phone. The result is then spoken out loud using Amazon Polly. This demo is deployed using the AWS CLI (command line interface) with scripting techniques.
The second demo is a podcast generator which connects to any RSS feed and converts that feed into a podcast. The result can then be played on iTunes or any podcast player. This demo uses AWS Lambda and Amazon Polly and is deployed using the Serverless framework.

*Session: Build a Chatbot in 10 minutes*
In this presentation I'll show you how to use Amazon Lambda and Lex to build a working chatbot in just a few minutes. No prior experience is required, you'll see how to use a simple starter kit built by myself and a friend to rapidly set up a bot. This is a great way to get your hands dirty with serverless programming on the AWS platform, and have some fun writing a bot!

*Session: Kubernetes Serverless Frameworks - An Implementation Story*
Serverless frameworks are changing the way we do computing. In open source container world, Kubernetes is playing a pivotal role in manifesting this. This presentation will go deep into various features of Kubernetes to create serverless functions.
Also includes a comparative study of various serverless frameworks such as Kubeless, Fission and Funktion are available in open source world. Will conclude with an implementation demo and some real world use cases.

*Session: Creating Event Driven Serverless Applications*

Serverless platform can be a very good fit for event driven applications. In this session, we will explore what are event driven applications, their architecture and how serverless platform can be leveraged for creating such applications. We will also explore what are best practices when developing such applications, touching upon areas like security, code portability, modularizing code and relevant patterns, and data proximity issues. This will be followed up by a Demo of event driven Application deployed on serverless platform.

*Serverless: Why it is hot and what it is not?*

According to Gartner, by 2022, most Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings will evolve to a fundamentally serverless model, rendering the cloud platform architectures dominating in 2017 as legacy architectures! But why is it the hottest technology on the planet and why is it a game changer? And what it is not and what aspects should we be careful about before adopting serverless? What are the key benefits of serverless approach and what are the main applications of serverless? In this session we answer these questions and more. We explore serverless from use case perspective with code examples. We also cover three demos for applying serverless approach: a chatbot, a real-time re-tweeting application, and a website. Step-by-step instructions for implementing them on your own will be shared to you, so you can try them on your own after the talk!

*Session: How to Model Serverless Apps for Multi Clouds*

One of the key challenges in using serverless applications in public clouds such as AWS, Azure and Google cloud is how to model and maintain the configuration of the functions and other services of the cloud provider. Serverless provides a clean way to model the functions and services in a declarative manner while providing a way to automate and scale deployments of serverless functions. You can also write plugins to extend functionality for specific use cases that are not available in the serverless framework
